		<h1>FAQs</h1>
		<div class=faqs>
			<h2>Teleports</h2>
			<div class=q>Q: I've found a room action that tells me to "move anywhere in room XX"... but I've not discovered room XX yet! Is that right?</div>
			<div class=a>A: Yes! Some teleports in Stampadia may lead you to undiscovered rooms. To execute the action, find the destination room in the Rooms Table, draw it on the map, and place the Hero Token in any valid position you like in that room. Remember that you must read a room description when your Hero Token enters it <u>only</u>, so don't read the destination room description before using the teleport!</div>
			<div class=q>Q: I moved the Hero Token on a gray numbered square to teleport in another room. Should I move the token on a gray numbered square in the destination room?</div>
			<div class=a>A: No. Teleports usually have a room action that says "move anywhere in room XX". So you may place the Hero Token anywhere that's valid: on an empty cell and nothing happens or, if you feel brave, on a gray numbered cell and trigger some room condition. After reading some destination room conditions, you will soon discover that there may be two-way teleports in Stampadia. You can still decide to teleport your Hero on the way back, giving him that Portal feeling we all know. :)</div>
			<h2>Exploring</h2>
			<div class=q>Q: I've no unexplored doors I can reach on my map but there are still rooms in the Rooms Table that I've not found. Why?</div>
			<div class=a>A: An old Stampadian proverb about completism says "Never trust the Rooms Table and the Map!". On the adventure sheet there is a lot of fake stuff like enemies, doors, and rooms to avoid spoilers. So, If you never found a room it never existed. Or not?</div>
			<h2>Fighting</h2>
			<div class=q>Q: How many HP does an enemy with no HP checkbox on its symbol have?</div>
			<div class=a>A: No HP. So the enemy will die on the next damage he will get. In Stampadia the Hero and the enemies will die when they run out of HP and must get another damage. You can watch a better explanation of the health system in the <a class=mark href="https://youtu.be/JlkrM9G8ccw">basics video</a>.</div>
			<h2>More</h2>
			<div class=q>Q: I have more questions!</div>
			<div class=a>A: Don't worry! There's a Discord server <a href='https://discord.gg/EDYP2N4RMn'>here</a>. We talk about everything Stampadia there and you may ask questions about the rules in the #help-rules channel.</div>
